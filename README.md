# Why aphid virus retention needs more attention: modelling aphid behaviour and virus manipulation in non-persistent plant virus transmission
This is the respository with code to accompany the study titled as above, by Falla and Cunniffe, published in PLOS Computational Biology.

The script *create_Fig4a.R* recreates Fig 4a from the paper, showing how all three models in the paper - the MIP model, the BAR model, and our new MIP-BAR model - can be solved numerically, and giving a default parameterisation for all three models.

Acronyms:
* MIP = Multiple Infective Probes
* BAR = Behaviour-based Aphid Rates
